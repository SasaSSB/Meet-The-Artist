 An app that provides an easier way for art galleries to find artists.
 
## Description

This application is a prototype designed to facilitate communication between art galleries and active artists by providing an accessible platform to view and manage artist information. 
The application serves as a bridge, allowing galleries to easily access key details about artists, including their names, bio, contact information, and artistic portfolio(will be an art photo link).
its a prototype, the application will utilize a manual JSON file as a data source, enabling testing and refinement before integrating real artist information.
